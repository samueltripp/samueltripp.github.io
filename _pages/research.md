**Research**

My research is in low-dimensional topology under the guidance of [Ina Petkova]. I am currently focusing mostly on tangle Floer homology and combinatorial versions of knot Floer homology. I also work on connections with Khovanov homology, and applications to contact topology. My current research statement can be seen [here.]

**Publications and Pre-prints**
[On grid homology for lens space links: combinatorial invariance and integral coefficients]
[L-space knots with tunnel number $>1$ by experiment] (with C. Anderson, K. Baker, X. Gao, M. Kegel, K. Le, K. Miller, S. Onaran, G. Sangston, A. Wood, and A. Wright), to appear in Experimental Mathematics
[Controlling the generic formal fiber of local domains and their polynomial rings] (with P. Jiang, A. Kirkpatrick, S. Loepp, and S. Mack-Crane)

**Prior Work**

My first year of graduate school I was very fortunate to be involved in a project on Hilbert modular forms. I helped compute canonical graded rings of parallel weight HMFs, and specialized Siegel modular forms/Igusa invariants to these spaces.

As an undergraduate, my REU research was focused on commutative algebra; namely the level of control over the generic formal fiber of complete local rings.
