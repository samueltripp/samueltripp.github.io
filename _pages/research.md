**Research**

My research is in low-dimensional topology under the guidance of [Ina Petkova]. I mostly focus on Heegaard Floer and Khovanov homologies, and various spectral sequences relating different flavors of these. I often think about problems locally, on the level of tangles.

**Prior Work**

My first year of graduate school I was very fortunate to be involved in a project on Hilbert modular forms. I helped compute canonical graded rings of parallel weight HMFs, and specialized Siegel modular forms/Igusa invariants to these spaces.

As an undergraduate, my REU research was focused on commutative algebra; namely the level of control over the generic formal fiber of complete local rings.
