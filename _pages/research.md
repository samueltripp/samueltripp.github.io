**Research**

My primary research focus is on mentoring undergraduate work. This includes [MQPs], WPI's closest equivalent to a senior thesis, and other research projects. If you are interested in a project in knot theory, low-dimensional topology, or topological data analysis, get in touch! Or if you just want to chat to see if we have any overlapping interests, let me know. 

**Prior Work**

My dissertation was in low-dimensional topology, focusing on the combinatorial and computational aspects of knot Floer homology. I also did an REU as an undergraduate in commutative algebra, and my first year of graduate school joined a project on Hilbert modular forms. An older version of my research statement from when I was on the job market in the fall of 2021 can be found [here.]
