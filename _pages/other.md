This page serves as a landing spot for my interests outside of math (or at least, outside of my math research). I love playing squash, and occasionally enjoy running.
I am very lucky to be able to get outside and hike in the beautiful mountains and trails of New England; I also occasionally bike and paddle. I track some of my activity on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/19579792).

I love reading and learning new ideas, from books, articles, or anything else (and I particularly like recommendations of others). You can find out what I am reading [here](/other/reading.md). If you have anything you have read recently and enjoyed, please [let me know!](mailto:samuel.tripp1@gmail.com)

Finally, I have a number of talented friends and acquaintances I have met throughout the years. [Check out what they are working on!](/other/projects.md)
