**Welcome!** I am currently an Assistant Teaching Professor at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. I recently received my PhD from Dartmouth College under the instruction of Ina Petkova. My research is in low-dimensional topology and knot homologies, and I care deeply about teaching. This website compiles information about my teaching and research, as well as sparse information about my other hobbies and an occasional blog post.
