**Welcome!** I am currently an Assistant Professor of Teaching at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. My office is Stratton Hall 305. I am mainly focused on teaching mathematics well, as well as doing undergraduate research projects with students. My dissertation was in low-dimensional topology under Ina Petkova. This website compiles information about my teaching and research, as well as sparse information about my other hobbies and an occasional blog post.
