Teaching is the most important thing I do. 

**WPI**

I am teaching [MA 2071], Matrices and Linear Algebra I, in A Term 2022. 

**Dartmouth College**

I taught [Math 20], Probability, in the spring of 2022. 

I taught [Math 31], Topics in Algebra, in the summer of 2020. This course was remote. 

I taught [Math 1] in the fall of 2019, and many of my course materials can be found on the course webpage.

The Dartmouth math department's teaching seminar culminates in two, week-long [math camps](https://math.dartmouth.edu/activities/exploring-mathematics/). In 2019, we ran one week on Networks in the Real World, and one week on A Mathematical Approach to Winning.

At Dartmouth, I have also been the TA for [Math 24], [Math 13] twice, and [Math 11]. At Dartmouth, graduate TAs are responsible for office-hour like sessions we call tutorials, and grading exams.

**Williams College**

I had a number of instructional experiences during my undergraduate years at Williams College. These included twice being the TA for discrete math courses, once being the lab TA for a data sciences course, and being a tutor in many capacities; for calculus as part of the college's central clearinghouse, and for chemistry and physics for high schoolers.
