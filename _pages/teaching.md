Teaching is the most important thing I do. I am interested in many areas of math pedagogy, including active learning, alternative grading, games in the classroom, metacognition, and project-based learning. I am most interested in learning from and with others, so please get in touch and let's talk about your experiences with any of these in the classroom. 

**WPI**

I have taught a number of classes at WPI, including Calculus 3, Denksport, Matrices and Linear Algebra I, Accelerated Matrices and Linear Algebra I, Matrices and Linear Algebra II, Group Theory, and three courses in the Masters in Math for Educators program: Linear Models, Numbers, Polynomials, and Algebraic Structures, and Discrete Mathematics. I am looking forward to teaching a wider variety of classes as I continue at WPI. I have also led independent studies in topology, algebraic topology, and knot theory. 

**Prior to WPI**

As a graduate student, I was the instructor of record for Probability, Topics in Algebra, and Calculus I at Dartmouth College. I also TAed a number of courses as both a graduate student and undergraduate student, and co-led two, week-long [math camps].
