I strongly prefer to support the industry of friends or friends of friends. I have compiled the fruits of labor and love of friends and acquaintances here, in the hopes that maybe you will see something that tickles your fancy.

**Film and Photo**

[Matt Echelman](https://matthewechelman.com) is amongst my closest friends, and is a diligent filmmaker and storyteller.

My cousin, [Katye Martens Brier](https://www.katyemartensbrier.com/), and her husband Joe Brier are the best photographers and wedding photographers I could imagine, as [Maple and Main Media](https://www.mapleandmainmedia.com/).

The loveliest of friends [Christine Reighley](https://christinereighley.com/) and Cam Held own and operate [Maine The Way](https://mtwquarterly.com/), my favorite publication.

**Music**

Fellow cross-country-cyclist Jack Davis makes the best garage surf punk music I have heard, with his band [Birdgangs](https://birdgangs.com/), and you should check them out live if given the chance.

I went to college with [Mari](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3pl23KkxEpDvK77RU5V7S9?si=OtjwhBadQM21Ey5j3yrQXQ), whose music I can't get enough of.

One of my oldest and dearest friends is [Jake Arthur](https://www.jakearthurmusic.com/), and I am lucky to have been listening to him for many of those years.

[Bar Scott](https://barscott.com/) has made some of my favorite music I have ever had the pleasure of hearing, which makes sense as she is one of the most lovely people.

**Physical Goods**

A friend from high school, I have admired [Steve Buduo's](http://www.stevebuduo.com/) art from afar for many, many years.

A friend of a friend from college, I have admired [Lucie Coleman's](https://www.lmcprintshop.com/) prints for fewer years, but to no less satisfaction.

Read what Garth's goal is at [Franklin Woodworking](http://www.franklinwoodworking.com/). He achieves it, with every piece I have seen.

**Story Telling**

Lauren's newsletter, [Keats-Free Zone](https://tinyletter.com/KFZ), always brightens my day when it lands in my inbox.

Eric's project on [Biodiversity in Vermont](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/collections/3bce9804f297409badc0833c40989552) inspires me to look at the world with fresh eyes.

I love hearing people talk about topics they are passionate and knowledgeable about, especially if I know nothing about them. [Keelia](https://doulakeelia.com/) does that with her co-host Ajira on [Doula Stories](https://www.doulastories.com/).
