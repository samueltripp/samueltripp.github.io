I have not kept up with my regular reading updates! I am sorry. This is a recap of sorts, since my January post, where I will just highlight some thoughts, but not review each book I read.

I have read some graphic novels, namely _Maus_ and two-thirds of the _March_ series about/by John Lewis. Maus knocked my socks off, and March didn't. I will still finish and read the third at some point, but it didn't capture me in much the same way.

_War is a Racket_ was a fun time capsule of the military industrial complex. I encourage you to read it, especially because it is so short.

I read a few more books from the Harlem Renaissance and its carry-on effects. These were _Cane_, by Jean Toomer, which felt disjointed and I think was; it wasn't intended to be a book in its original iteration. But certainly still carried power. _Passing_ by Nella Larsen is clearly the root of lots of modern-day media, and I enjoyed it thoroughly. I loved the bestsellers of the war-years: _Native Son_ by Richard Wright and _The Street_ by Ann Petry. Both were so powerful. _Native Son_ built and held tension as well as any book I have read.

I've also read a few books that have been fairly nonconventional in either plot or character development. _A Particular Kind of Black Man_ by Tope Folarin did some of this, but was still fairly predictable. I wish it had delved deeper. The book I am still thinking about is _Trust Exercise_ by Susan Choi. I had seen this book around, but expected it to be a fairly straightforward coming-of-age novel about two high-schoolers. It is not. Whew.

Two other pairs of books come to mind. The first pair is _Elite Capture_ and _The Right to Sex_, which are philosophical-based thoughts on modern-day issues. Much of _Elite Capture_ didn't land with me, but it was still thought-provoking. _The Right to Sex_ was right up my alley; thought-provoking, nuanced, and well-written. The second pair is _These Truths_ and _Sapiens_. Both are monumental undertakings, trying to tell the history of the United States and of humankind, respectively, in one book. _These Truths_ was fascinating and I learned a lot. _Sapiens_ fell flat for me. I am looking forward to reading a similar book, _The Dawn of Everything_, which is a history of humanity, this fall.

Overall, since January I have read 22 books, twelve of which were nonfiction and ten of which were fiction.
