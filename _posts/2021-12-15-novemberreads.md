I am again combining two months. I read four books in October and November, only one of which was fiction.

_Corregidora_, by Gayl Jones:\
Gayl Jones is a writer of some renown (and controversy) who is published her first book in 22 years this year. I had never heard of her, but on reading the Times write-up was intrigued, and so decided to read this, her debut novel. It is an intense read but powerful in its depiction of generational trauma. The memory of this trauma, so willfully preserved, takes center stage, and colors all the characters and action. 68/100

_Epitaph for a Peach_, by David Masumoto:\
A fascinating story of what it takes to grow an heirloom variety of peaches using natural methods at commercial scale. I learned a lot about farming, and probably less than I should have about the lessons on life Masumoto tried to teach through allegory, because some of this book just didn't capture my attention. 65/100

_Crying in H Mart_, by Michelle Zauner:\
This book spoke to grief really powerfully. The practicalities of watching someone you love die are so tough to write, but Zauner did it well. 83/100

_What we Know About Climate Change_, by Kerry Emmanuel:\
A succinct, clear description of the state of climate science. It wouldn't persuade a climate skeptic, but it arms me with more information to have those conversations on my own, to some extent. Encourage it as a good summary for anyone interested. 72/100
